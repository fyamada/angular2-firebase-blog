### An personal blog site based on [Angular 2](https://angular.io) as front end and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) 

This repo was seeded by [angular2-webpack-starter] (https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3**
> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.ts`](/src/app/app.ts)

```bash
# clone our repo
# --depth 1 removes all but one .git commit history
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/fyamada/angular2-firebase-blog.git

### Firebase configuration
You need to create your firebase account and project. Once you have a project, open it and select <b>Add Firebase to your web app<b> in the overview screen.
This will pop up a panel with the configuration data you need to set in the /config/webpack.dev.js and /config/webpack.prod.js
